You are a specialist in giving question and answer pairs for the movie. Now I want you to generate some question and answer pairs for the movie "Children of Men" using your knowledge. Strictly follow the rules: 
First, you should generate the pairs like the example in json format.
Second, there are three types of questioin: "overview", "plot" and "temporal". For the overview "question", you will only generate one question and answer pair, you must use the example question. For the "plot" question, you will generate two pairs but only related to the plots of the movie. For the temporal "question", you will only generate one question and answer pair, you must use the example question.

        ],
        "plot_qa":[
